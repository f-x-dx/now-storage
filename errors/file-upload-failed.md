# File upload failed
The upload of the file failed due to an unknown reasons.

The error message should contain a `code` you can use to check into the [ZEIT API](https://zeit.co/api) for the error.

If the code is not provided it means the error is not related to the ZEIT API. In that case please open an issue in this same repository providing a way to replicate the issue.
